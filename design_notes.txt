Reserve for UART:
IOB_23a     - TX (out)
IOB_25b_g3  - RX (in)

SPI reserved
IOB_32a     SPI_SO
IOB_33b     SPI_SI
IOB_34a     SPI_SCK
IOB_35b     SPI_SS_B

Button scheme:
4 buttons, 2 L/R on left side, 2 1/0 on right side

- L/R to choose bit or function position
- FN LEDs to show the currently selected function group
- 3 modes:
    - idle mode - no editing
    - A/D mode - edit A/D switches
    - FN mode - Choose or toggle a FN switch
- 5 LEDs to choose the FN group in (1/0) format
    - R/S - Run/Stop
        - Strobe R to start the CPU running, S to stop
    - SS/SS - Single Step
        - Single step the CPU. Same for both function states
    - EX/EN - Examine / Examine Next
        - EX - Select address and show data at the current A/D on DATA
        - EN - Same as EX but increment addr after
    - D/DN - Deposit / Deposit Next
        - D -  Deposit the lower 8 bits of the A/D switches at the current addr (selected by EX/EN)
        - DN - Same as D but increment addr after
    - RS/EC - Reset / Everything Clear?

Modal control state machine
Key    |   in idle mode    in A/D mode     in FN mode
-------+-----------------------------------------------
  L    |   Enter A/D       Choose bit      Choose FN
  R    |   Enter FN        Choose bit      Choose FN
  1    |   Exec curr FN 1  Set bit         Exec FN 1
  0    |   Exec curr FN 0  Clear bit       Exec FN 0
 L+R   |   NONE            Return to idle  Return to idle
 Hold 1|   Exec curr FN 1  Exec curr FN 1  Select FN & return to idle
 Hold 0|   Exec curr FN 0  Exec curr FN 0  Select FN & return to idle

NOTE: Keeping EX/EN and D/DN separate FNs makes it (more) inconvenient to enter code

LEDs needed:
- 16 address display / A/D input switch indicators
- 8 D output
- 8 control
    - MEMR
    - INP
    - MI
    - OUT
    - HLTA
    - STACK
    - W0
    - INT
- 5 FN
    - R/S
    - SS/SS
    - EX/EN
    - D/DN
    - RS/EC

Speculative - Multiplexing LEDs:
- 8 bits per column
- 5 columns
    - A[15:8]
    - A[7:0]
    - D[7:0]
    - STAT[7:0]
    - FN[4:0]
- Uses 13 I/Os, fits entirely within spare group 1 pins
- Per-IO sink is 8mA
- Use 5x drive transistors for high side
